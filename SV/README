This directory has an example of indirect inference via neural net for a
simple discrete time stochastic volatility model. This runs on julia 1.x and
current Flux.jl, one of the actively maintained deep learning packages.

To use this:

1. download the code to some directory
2. cd to the SV subdirectory and start julia
3. create the training data and Monte Carlo data by
    include("MakeData.jl")
5. train the net and see results by
    include("Train.jl")
