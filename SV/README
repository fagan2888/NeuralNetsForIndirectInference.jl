This directory has an example of indirect inference via neural net for a
simple discrete time stochastic volatility model. This runs on julia 1.x and
current Flux.jl, one of the actively maintained deep learning packages.

To use this:

1. download the code to some directory
2. cd to that directory and start julia
3. activate the project by typing
    ] activate .
4. create the data by
    include("MakeData.jl")
5. train the net and see results by
    include("Train.jl")
